# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
Question 15 on page 126 at the end of Chapter 3 of the textbook ISLR (James et al, 2014). This asks you to use R for linear regression with least squares on the Boston dataset from the MASS library. Complete part (b) of this question:

Fit a multiple regression model to predict the response using all of the predictors. Describe your results. For which predictors can we reject the null hypothesis
  H0 : j = 0?
Now repeat this using each of the following regularisation approaches:
1. ridge regression (_l2_)
2. lasso (_l1_)
3. elastic net (_l1_ and _l2_).
